# Omeka S static pages

This repository contains static HTML pages that are served outside of Laminas
and do have the same branding and color scheme as the [Omeka S theme UM](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-Library/omekas-theme-um).


### Usage
1. Put the HTML file(s) in the root of the Omeka S installation, e.g. `/var/www/html/`
2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL of the static page. Example: https://digitalcollections.library.maastrichtuniversity.nl/terms-of-use.html
